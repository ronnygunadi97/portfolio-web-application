# Portfolio Landing Page

This is a modern, responsive portfolio landing page built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
It currently features content extracted from `Ronny Gunadi - CV Updated.pdf`.

## Getting Started

First, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new).

1.  Push this code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Go to Vercel and "Add New Project".
3.  Import your repository.
4.  Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and deploy.

Alternatively, if you have the Vercel CLI installed:

```bash
vercel
```
